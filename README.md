## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Thomas.

I'm studying a master's degree in software engineering at [Aalborg University](https://cs.aau.dk), currently working on my master's thesis in distributed systems. My master's thesis has most of its code available as free software at [Our Organisation](https://github.com/aau-p9s).

I'm working as a software developer at Lyngsoe Systems A/S. My CV is available at [CV](https://github.com/Mast3rwaf1z/CV)

I volunteer as both a software contributor to [F-klubben](https://github.com/f-klubben) providing code review and ~~sometimes questionable~~ unrequested pull requests, as well as taking an interest in planning and volunteering with the study association. I believe the key to keeping students motivated and deeper understanding is to breed a study environment that engages students in meaningful conversation on the study material.

I have a great interest in learning new paradigms, as I enjoy attacking a problem from a new angle. I take an interest in distributed systems and distributed computing and is an active member of [Aalborg supercomputer klub](https://github.com/aalborg-supercomputer-klubben).

If you want to know more about me and my projects, you can always take a look at my [website](https://skade.dev)
