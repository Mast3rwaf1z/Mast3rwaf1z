## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Thomas.

I'm studying for a M.Sc. Software degree, currently working on my master's thesis in distributed systems. My master's thesis has most of its code available as free software @ [Our Organisation](https://github.com/aau-p9s)

I have a great interest in learning new paradigms, as I enjoy attacking a problem from a new angle. I take an interest in distributed systems and distributed computing and is an active member of [Aalborg supercomputer klub](https://github.com/aalborg-supercomputer-klubben).

If you want to know more about me and my projects, you can always take a look at my [website](https://skade.dev)
