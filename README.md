## Hi there 👋
I'm Thomas.

All code related to my self hosted server is found [here](https://github.com/Skademaskinen)

* 📚 I graduated with a master's degree in software engineering at [Aalborg University](https://cs.aau.dk) in 2025 with a master's thesis in distributed systems. My master's thesis has most of its code available as free software at [Our Organisation](https://github.com/aau-p9s).

* 💼 As of August 2025, I'm working as a software developer at Cobham SATCOM. Check out my [CV](https://github.com/Mast3rwaf1z/CV)

* 🏫 I've volunteered as both a software contributor to [F-klubben](https://github.com/f-klubben) providing code review and ~~sometimes questionable~~ unrequested pull requests, as well as took an interest in planning and volunteering with the study association. I believe the key to keeping students motivated and deeper understanding is to breed a study environment that engages students in meaningful conversation on the study material. For more information, see [fklub.dk](https://fklub.dk)

* 🖥️ I have a great interest in learning new paradigms, as I enjoy attacking a problem from a new angle. I take an interest in distributed systems and distributed computing and is an active member of [Aalborg supercomputer klub](https://github.com/aalborg-supercomputer-klubben).

* 📄 If you want to know more about me and my projects, you can always take a look at my [website](https://skade.dev)
